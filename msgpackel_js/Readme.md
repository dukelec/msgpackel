Little-endian version of the msgpack javascript library, modified from ygoe/msgpack v1.0.3

Because the original author did not use DataView to convert data uniformly (only for float conversion),
it is difficult to add an option to support both big-endian and little-endian.

Usage please refer to original project: https://github.com/ygoe/msgpack.js
