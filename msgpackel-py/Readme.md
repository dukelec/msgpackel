Little-endian version of the msgpack python library, modified from u-msgpack-python v2.7.1

Because the original code is compatible with python2, adding an option to configure endianness is more troublesome,
so I did not add the option for now.

Usage please refer to original project: https://github.com/vsergeev/u-msgpack-python  
(use `import umsgpackel as umsgpack` instead.)
