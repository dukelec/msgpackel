MessagePackEL
====================================

This is the little-endian version of MessagePack, except the endianness is different,
the rest is exactly the same as MessagePack.



C library: [msgpackel-c](msgpackel-c)


MIME type for original msgpack: `application/msgpack`  
MIME type for msgpackel: `application/msgpackel`

By convention, `el` is the initials of "little-endian" read in little-endian order.
