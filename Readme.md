====================================

This is the little-endian version of MessagePack, except the endianness is different,
the rest is exactly the same as MessagePack.



C library: [msgpackel-c](msgpackel-c)

Python library: [msgpackel-py](msgpackel-py) (u-msgpack-python)

Javascript library: [msgpackel-js](msgpackel-js) (ygoe/msgpack)
