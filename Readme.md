MessagePackEL
====================================

This is the little-endian version of MessagePack, except the endianness is different,
the rest is exactly the same as MessagePack.



C library: [msgpackel_c](msgpackel_c)

Python library: [msgpackel_py](msgpackel_py) (u-msgpack-python)

Javascript library: [msgpackel_js](msgpackel_js) (ygoe/msgpack)
